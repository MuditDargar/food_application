# Running React on Repl.it with Vite

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Vite is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

## Getting Started

1. Open this project on Repl.it.
2. Hit the "Run" button.
3. Edit `App.jsx` and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the configuration file. Here are the [Vite docs for serving production websites](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html).

## Typescript

If you prefer TypeScript, it's easy to switch:

1. Rename any file from `.jsx` to `.tsx`.
2. You can also try our [TypeScript Template](https://replit.com/@yourusername/typescript-template).

Happy coding!
